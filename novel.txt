This is the first page of my novel
Will is sitting in a park. He notices a sound from the back.
He looks back. He sees nothing. He keeps looking. 
Seeing nothing abnormal he begins to turn back and to his front
he sees there is Bess standing. She yells at him
"Hey! what's up!" scaring Will.
Bess wants some heroin. If Will doesn't provide it to her she'll
create drama in front of Will's wife.
Will is tired of Bess. He says "No Heroin for ya!".
Bess walks away. Will knows she'll come back.
But he doesn't care. He recently became a cop and isn't 
scared of Bess anymore. Will carries a gun 
with him, along with heroin. He isn't afraid to use it 
on people like Bess.
